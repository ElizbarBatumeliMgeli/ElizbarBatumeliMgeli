🚀 About Me (Send Help, I'm Trapped in Xcode)

Hey there! I'm Elizbar, and I spend my days deep in the Apple ecosystem, crafting beautiful (and occasionally bewildering) apps using Swift.

My workflow usually involves 5% coding, 95% debugging why a List decided to ignore the padding modifier.

"I spent 3 hours debating whether to use a struct or a class. I chose struct. The bug was in my API call." - Me, probably.

☕️ My Status: A Vibe Check (Meme Edition)

I like to call this section "The Life Cycle of an iOS Developer's Sanity."

When the new feature works perfectly on the first try

When you realize you need to support iOS 14 legacy code

SwiftUI is magic and I am a god.

Gotta update my project's minimum deployment target... again.

Tech

Status/Vibe

Swift

The main weapon. Optional unwrapping is my cardio.

SwiftUI

Building UIs like I'm playing with digital LEGOs (sometimes they fall apart under gravity).

Combine

Reactive programming that makes my brain hurt in a good way. Like functional programming, but for time.

Xcode

The massive, beautiful beast that simultaneously fuels my passion and tests my sanity.

Git

git push --force is a myth. (Or is it?)

👽 Fun Facts & Commit Messages

Favorite Error: Thread 1: Fatal error: Unexpectedly found nil while unwrapping an Optional value (The true horror film of iOS development.)

Most Common Commit Message: "Fixed a thing." (The ultimate detail.)

Life Goal: To get through a major Xcode update without any environment variables spontaneously combusting.

May your build times be short and your optionals always be unwrapped.
